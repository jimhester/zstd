# Stop

- When first running 'usethis::use_cpp11()' the directions about 'copy and paste the following in R/zstd-package' I think could be more literal by saying "copy and paste into a new file". It was easy for me to gloss over this minor detail

- I think the docs could be a little better about tying together the differences/similarites between cpp11/Rcpp and C++. I find myself really having to dig to learn about what a raw data type is. 
  - I know of someone else who had to write an R package in C++ who said it was confusing. They also know both R and C++
  - For example I find using RAW() a little unintuitive?


# Go


- I really liked the red dots and green check marks in the instructions after running 'usethis::use_cpp11()'
